## Cost-Efficient Drinking, for everyone

**Cedrik** (short for **c**ost-**e**fficient **dri**n**k**ing) is a calculator
to help you choose between different types and brands of liquors and beers,
as well as different drink recipes so you can find the best cost-efficiency
when buying the drinks you like.

I made this as a hobby project and it doesn't include everything I'd like it to,
so I will keep working on it.
